The Forensic Evidence Analyzer is a Windows Forms application designed to simulate forensic investigation by analyzing a crime-scene file
represented as a 2D grid of characters. Each character in the grid corresponds to a specific type of evidence—fingerprints, DNA, fiber, or blood—and
the program uses object-oriented programming principles to identify and count these markers. Users can load any text file containing a crime-scene grid,
choose the desired type of analyzer through the interface, and instantly receive results based on the evidence found. The project demonstrates
inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract class design, featuring a three-level hierarchy (Analyzer → DNAAnalyzer → BloodAnalyzer) as well as independent 
analyzers for fingerprints and fibers.
